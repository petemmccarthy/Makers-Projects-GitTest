Pyongyang (평양, Korean pronunciation: [pʰjɔŋjaŋ], literally: Flat Land or Peaceful Land, approved: P’yŏngyang;[4] several variants[5]) is the capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, commonly known as North Korea, and the largest city in the country. Pyongyang is located on the Taedong River and, according to preliminary results from the 2008 population census, has a population of 3,255,388.[6] The city was split from the South P'yŏngan province in 1946. It is administered as a directly governed city (chikhalsi), on the same level as provincial governments, not a special city (teukbyeolsi) as Seoul is in South Korea.
